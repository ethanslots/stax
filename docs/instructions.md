## Logic
chars  	|Name        	|Description
---    	|---         	|---
`!`  	|not         	|Logical not.  Produces 0 or 1.  Numeric 0 and empty lists are considered falsy.  All other values are truthy.
`<`  	|less        	|Is less than.  Arrays use string-style lexicographic ordering.
`>`  	|greater     	|Is greater than.  Arrays use string-style lexicographic ordering.
`=`  	|equal       	|Equals.  Numberic types are coerced as necessary.  Arrays are equal to scalars if their first element is equal.
`?`  	|if-then-else	|If the first value, then yield the second, else the third.  If the result is a block, execute it.
`\|4`	|is-array    	|Tests if a value is an array or not.  Produces 0 or 1.

## String
Strings are really just arrays of integers, but some operations are oriented towards strings anyway.  In these contexts, 0 is usually converted to 32, so that 0 can be used as a space in addition to its normal codepoint.

Unterminated string literals will be printed implicitly.  `` ` `` is the escape character for `` ` `` and `"`. The characters `01234` yield `\0 \n \t \r \v` respectively when escaped. All other escaped single characters will execute as stax code and then include the popped value as a template. (Space is no-op)

## Registers
chars	|Description
---  	|---
`x`  	|Value of register x.  Default is parsed integer value from standard input, or 0.

`\|X`	|Increment register x and push.  If x is not an integer, set it to 0 first.
`y`  	|Value of register y.  Default is first line of standard input.
`Y`  	|Peek and write register y.
`\|y`	|Decrement register y and push.  If y is not an integer, set it to 0 first.
`\|Y`	|Increment register y and push.  If y is not an integer, set it to 0 first.

## Prefix Directives
Some instructions behave differently when they are the first character in a program.  These directives do not apply if the implicit eval of standard input succeeded.

char	|Name        	|Description
--- 	|---         	|---
`f` 	|line-filter 	|Use the rest of the program to filter input lines.  Print lines that produce a truthy result.
`F` 	|line-foreach	|Execute the rest of the program once for each line of input.
`m` 	|line-map    	|Map each line of standard input.  Print each result with a newline.
`i` 	|no-eval     	|Suppress auto-eval.  e.g. If the input is a binary number, this will prevent incorrectly parsing it as an integer.
